intro: A project that uses gaming and computerized simulations to study planning for mobility infrastructure and policy.
description: <p class="simple-content">The Joint Road Forward is a multi-year project aimed at developing gaming and simulation methods to better design mobility infrastructure and policies, leveraging different forms of relevant data, and participatory methods. <p/><p class="simple-content">The research project is a collaboration between academia and industry in India and the Netherlands, with a goal to learn from both contexts. We will use mobility data mining methods to build  specific mobility models, which form the base for the gaming and simulation platform.</p><p class="simple-content">Our approach leverages both gaming and computerized simulations, built and validated using data from Indian and Dutch contexts. Computerized simulations offer a space for experimentation at scales of cities, and gaming simulations provide the ability to use participatory approaches enabling multiple stakeholder engagement.<p/>
