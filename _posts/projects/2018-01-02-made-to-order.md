intro: ‘Made to Order’ is a game developed by Fields of View for Gender Bender 2017, a production by Sandbox Collective and Goethe Institut Bangalore/Max Mueller Bhavan.
description: <p class="simple-content">Gender Bender is an annual event where artists and groups are invited to propose ideas that challenge current ideas around gender. For Gender Bender 2017, Fields of View proposed to create a game that would let the audience take a step back and explore the intersecting dimensions of gender, caste, and class, how they frame our view of the world, and how intricately they are bound. Fields of View was one of the ten grantees chosen from almost 120 entries from the country, and around the world.</p><p class="simple-content">In ‘Made to Order’, participants take on the role of people whose lives are distant from their own. Instead of passively reading a case study or a report, in the game participants get to experience what it is to make daily decisions if one is hampered because of the constrictions placed by caste, class, and gender. The game becomes a powerful way to disseminate research, both qualitative and quantitative, as the game is modelled on data drawn from on-the-ground research.</p>
